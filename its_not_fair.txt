I cannot believe it. It just isn't fair
I've gotten in trouble. Why? I'm not aware
The crime I committed was nowhere near bad
They say I'm a felon. I'm only a lad
So here I am - sentenced to stay in my room
I swear, the injustice will make me go "Boom!"
I'm punching my pillow, screaming off my head
I'm making a terrible mess of my bed
I'm stamping my feet out of anger and more
I'm fighting temptation to kick down the door
I'm frustrated. Never again will I smile
Please give me a chance. I deserve a fair trial
I'm filled up with rage and I've torn up my shirt
How should I have known that a bullet would hurt?
