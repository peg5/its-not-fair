# What This Is
This is a poem that I wrote when I was eleven years old for my Language Arts class. The original text has been lost, but I remember it word for word and have reproduced it here.

#Why It Is Here
I am proud of the poem and hated to think that it was lost forever. I have put it up here to track changes while I work on the final draft.

Feel free to critique, revise or add to it on the Workshop branch.
