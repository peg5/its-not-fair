\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

I cannot believe it. It just isn't fair\\
I've gotten in trouble. Why? I'm not aware\\
The crime I committed was nowhere near bad\\
They say I'm a felon. I'm only a lad\\
So here I am - sentenced to stay in my room\\
I swear, the injustice will make me go ''Boom!''\\
I'm punching my pillow, screaming off my head\\
I'm making a terrible mess of my bed\\
I'm stamping my feet out of anger and more\\
I'm fighting temptation to kick down the door\\
I'm frustrated. Never again will I smile\\
Please give me a chance. I deserve a fair trial\\
I'm filled up with rage and I've torn up my shirt\\
How should I have known that a bullet would hurt?\\
\end{verse}
